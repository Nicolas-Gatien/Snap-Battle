# Snap Battle
This is a minigame datapack that turns your world into a mini survival battle royal.
The world is limited to a 1000 blocks wide, and for the first 30 minutes, the players need to gather resources.
After the first 30 minutes, the worldborder begins to shrink and players can be eliminated.

The datapack is named this way because my friends and I usually play this whenever a new snapshot is released.

## How to Play
Download the datapack.
In minecraft, run the following function:
```mcfunction
function snapbattle:start
```
That will start the game.
The game ends once there is only one player alive.
